                In a far far away kingdom, <b class = "colored">Arendelle</b>, surrounded by enormous mountains and valleys,
                with such beauty that once you visit this place, your soul does not want to ever leave,
                especially in the winter ðŸ‘€, lives the friendliest snowman known to man, <b class = "colored">Olaf</b>, a very kind,
                and humble mythical creature<br>
                He likes warm hugs, and this make him a true friend for everyone that get to truly know him. <br>
                This year, a very harsh winter hit <b class = "colored">Arendelle</b>, bringing with it a looot of evil snow, creating from the
                white puffy snow once known, monstruous, scary snow mans, the exactly opposite of our friend, <b class = "colored">Olaf</b>.<br>
                He send messages through his friends for someone who is brave and an experienced adventurer,
                outside the kingdom to help him and his friends fight the evil snow mans. Through the wind and faith,
                this message arrived to you.<br>
                Would you help him win back his winter?
            </p>
